# Chocola App Template
This is a template for starting a Chocola App with the basics.

## Getting Started
As of today, there is no `npx` command to build a Chocola App out of the box.
If you want to use this template, you may copy the code of this repository and set up NPM to install all dependencies needed for your project.

## Setting Up Chocola
Once you download and extract the template code, install Chocola and it's dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
Then, start the Chocola Dev Server to see how it looks:
```sh
npm run dev
```

## You're Ready
Now you are all set to start editing and baking your new Chocola App!

If you need instructions on how the framework works, head to the **[Chocola README](https://github.com/sad-gabi/chocola/blob/main/README.md)** and give it a read.

## Contributing
You can contribute by editing the template and uploading your code.
